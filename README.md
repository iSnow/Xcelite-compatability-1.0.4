## Xcelite 1.0.4 compatability testing lib
Not much to see here, the only reason this exists is to have a gold 
standard for compatiblity tests of new version against the last released
version 1.0.4

### How To Use?
Add xcelite compat as a dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
			<groupId>compat.com.ebay.xcelite_104</groupId>
			<artifactId>xcelite-104-compatibility-1.0.4-SNAPSHOT</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.4</version>
</dependency>
```
